## Overview

What do we have
    - For a selected group of tickers:
        - Optimizer that finds weights for portfolio with min risk that gives at least a target return (bar display of weights)
        - Efficeint fronteir graph: EF, random portfolios, and Max Sharpe Ratio point highlighted
        - Monte Carlo sims of portfolios
            - Simulate the optimal porfolio paths and other ones with similar return to compare worst case paths
            - Can compare avg paths but they end up being very similar 
        - Graph of Sharpe Ratio vs return 
        - Graph of Sharpe ratio vs. risk

    - Do some comparisons of 10 random assets: optimal vs evenly weights, and/or optimal vs randomly weighted
    - Compare picking from the whole nasdaq (or like top 20 biggest companies on nasdaq) vs the qqq index
